I have a normal phone and it made 1 of my pics look like one of a iphone 6 if u dont believe me look at my instagran account     wings_2004
Love it so much
Cant get to install
Too many ads and secondly erratic interface 
I have already uninstalled
Its so happy
Nicest systematic for Android phones
Its so easy and fun
Main diss app tight um hmmm
Everything is awesome
Ive downloaded a few different ones and this is easy to use, and the pictures come out great 
Plenty of options to choose from to make whatever kind of picture you would like
Like it but not so cool app
I really like the HD effect, brightness and color correction features 
I can basically change the whole pic   its so cool :-) lol :-)
I cant  believe  how easy  it is 
This app is very good for photos editer
It is just simple and Good app 
Its ok but u have to download stuff
Ive used this on my previous phone worked prrfectly but ive recntly bought samsung galaxy a5 the splash and focus functn doesnt work plz help!!
This is perfect 
If only you could make a video editor, too, that is just as good as this 
Makes awesome book covers!
Theres an ad after every other button I press
Its has alot of things awesome
This is awesome app 
its alright so far
I like how it is fast and easy to use!
lighter and faster than other photo editors ,with many editing options best recommended app for photo editing
super easy and i love the effects ,also super easy to install!!
Very good app
The app has very good features indeed   
I would give this app a 5 if there were not so many ads
never use it its fake
Easy to use!
Covers imperfections and has cool filters!
I love did App Its Amazing!!
Its a great app
Very useful, full features without any pro version purchase
I LOVE IT
There are so many ads popping up that the app is now unusable because an ad pops up literally every time I close the last 
I have used it 
Its a good app for photo editing 
You can so many things from this app 
You can download this app without fearing 
I`ve seen so many photo editing tools but this one is the best 10x a lot its really proffesional
I have a blast using this app with my eight yr old daughter!
Able to take r add to photo love it!
First, why do you need Access to my phone
Why are you running in background when i am not using you
Get off my phone!
Makes neat collages and great for editing
U have t ok down load every thing u want to add to it like the effects
A powerful photo editor with many wonderfull effects
Horrible editor, worst app in this entire store 
I give it half of no stars, stupid as a pair of inbred babies
Great Photo Editing App for editing Photos
verry nice app and i am happy this apps
its a great app to edit pics
Very satisfied with the results I get by using this software :)
Helped me make AMAZING photos
The best that one can get
I gave this app a 5 stars cause rate me pls always pops out and its annoying, good app though 
Loved using it 
Cant use d way i use CS6 in my lappy 
But its far bettrr than any other apps i tried on my phone   
Needs an airbrush feature
It helps me create amazing fotos 
They really need to think outside the box and get more creative  
think about what makes this app better than any other app and why we should get it  
thats some advice from a 12 year old  
take it or leave it
I would give it 5 stars, but there are a few bugs that could be fixed
The app has more options than Ill ever use 
It doesnt provide for a way to delete previously edited needless photos that are starting to accumulate in the gallery 
Cant obtain any help on how to delete just those photos while maintaining the original photo 
Ilike it but the other app are busy 
But i got the frames 
The best one I found so far
Love it    Love the enhanced picture qualities, the frames etc    
Easy very nice detail options and doesnt crash!
Would be better if there were more frame options tho
Have to download everything and adverts are annoying!
Its best
Best photo editor i have seen
Without Aviary this app cannot working
Great app     easy to use 
But has alot of popups 
Sud have an option to un blur the blur photos
its a cooooool app ever 
i like it   !!!!
Whenever I went to choose a photo then go back to it a blank black screen came up for a few seconds 
Also it seemed to only let me have one photo I couldnt see how to add in another photo 
The app is gud but reqire sum features more
This will be very helpfull to me 
I love being able to have fun  with my photo 
I can edit in many ways    It looks always perfect    so yea 3 thumbs up to this app
It perfects flaws and inperfections !!
Lol and its fun to use too!!
App is Brilliant   but only the thing due to which I gave 4 star not 5 is FONT     We cant change the FONT Text     
Love the affects when done
This aap is excellent     Love it  
( It works in my phone)
Doesnt even start  
Waste of time     
This works realy well the only thing I dont like about it is that u had to download the stickers
Best application in world
I have used many and this I like one better then many 
Wish i knew how to change font size
I reallly can fix my ugly pics
This app is pretty cool I think it works good
Well for one thing your app doesnt look anything like the pictures above and for another I got to edit one photo and then the app wouldnt open and kept force closing I hate it so I removed imedently
Not bad app 
nice editings cn be done overall good job 
This is good app
If they are free, why do I have to install the frames then the effects then other things     
just make it come with it 
Suprb app for creating more effect   
Like a picart
I dnt like that u cant redo or format the text
It is a great editor love it
I liked it so much 
You have to pay for stickers really
Works very well, easy, loaded
Perfect mobile photo editing app
It works for me
East or west this apps is best I try my best to choose some other apps and use them Thanks developer please keep it up 
I love it it makes me feel real with the effects n my blue eyes
This is ousome
Cant upload photos
Love the new ehancements
This might be good but Im write before playing this app!
Lots better than some 
Better than default editors 
its easy to use and has a good user interface 
You have to download everything before you CD an even start date it  so much it is rubbish for not install unless you like rubbish apps ‼‼‼‼‼‼‼‼‼‼‼:-\ :-\ :-\ :-\ :-\ :-\ :-\ :-\
Solid apppp I loved it
Making memes right now!
Hope do not make any trouble
Very user friendly 
needed to take off unwanted bits captured in the photo i took & this app did the trick!
Its looks great and nice I like it
Exactly the program I was looking for!
I have an HTC One M8 and for some reason this app opens and then closes without out any option for me to do anything 
My only question is if this has to do specifically with my phone 
Especially since it seems to work well for others 
Very good apps
Easy to use
Very good photo edit app
Cool app loved it

This is a great app to use
