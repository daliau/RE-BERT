Its ruining the overall experience 
Everything else is fine 
Its good but we receive unecessary notifications on the phone
Really love one
Though I wish there was a way to quickly scroll up to the top
Pradyut: I dont like this app because this app take several time
There is no the top bar 
I couldnt see it 
Please fix this bug 
I dont like that 
Finally is good
Can you stop making twitter freaking refresh everytime i go down the timeline and forcing me up to the top
Plis fix it!!!
I uninstall it and install it many times but i cant tweet or re-tweet
nice app, sleek 
Still loving it   
I still cant watch videos even though I updated my twitter
It will not let me install it base on an installation error 
Love twitter and the app is amazing can check it whenever I am and also tweet on the go :-D
Thank you sweeters i&lt;3this app
Does what is supposed to, and does it well 
a few times later ，i cant find where’s my top bar
This app is the way I access Twitter most often 
I prefer it to my MacBook 
Videos wont load at all, please fix 
I love twitter 
I love you
FIX THE LASTEST UPDATE PLEASEEEEE
This app locks keyboard to screen and requires restart 
Will reinstall when fixed 
even cant view my own timeline
My fr7ends told me its better than the other social medias but when i make my first account then follow and twit it says your account is susspended    
I like this this app
Timeline keeps jumping to the top and hours of tweets get lost 
Twitter ignores me every time I file this issue 
It works just fine 
Simple and easy to use 
The list doesnt appear anymore :(
Pls add one function to get back backup code   I will give 5 stars
I am totally disappointed with this update trends are showing wrong side & we can not easily back on the top when we reed tweets
Can be improved further!
I  finally ttx to the Harry styles
The subs on the app is right 
Thabks for making it,!
I almost liked it but when i downloaded it, i tried to open my account 
when i typed my account and pressed enter 
It says error occurred when logging in 
Please try again later is it just me
I cant open my Account 
This does not download
Something to stay in touch with the real world
Yes this is a nice app but come on, I mean, it updates every day or two and the update is just "bugs fixed" Im sick and tired of that 
Do it at least once a week or if its a huge update 
I dont get push notifications and also cant watch some videos 
Its rare if a video actually works 
Other than that, I can use it just fine 
Pause my music when I view a GIF 
When it refreshes content, it disregards what you are doing (ie scrolling, viewing a tweet) and automatically brings you to the top without warning 
Its working fine but it doesnt let me set a banner 
I cant see any photos that people tweet and where did the top bar go
Please fix this 
There is no option to switch from taking a photo to a video, why this is happen
Im using a samsung galaxy s4 
Just cuz there always has to be a negative rating but this app is awesome
Wtf    going on, I cant see the  photos
Frustrating it updates so often & only vague descriptions of what is in the updates 
Thanks for the quick camera fix
I cant add filtets w/ my pics with the lates version using my galaxy y pls fix this!
I love twitter
Nosey,Nosey,Nosey      
I like the app overall its just that sometimes notifications take a while to come through 
Otherwise its good
Its great app
I lost the updated twitter when I logged out my account 
I like this app
If it can do the push notification as well on the locked phone would be really great 
Talking on Android phone 
I have to pay RM1 a week to receive validation code for my phone
Cant follow people without the code
Keep up the good work!
I post some photos last night and when i browse it now i cant see it 
The home,discovery and activity tabs are not to be seen after update on app whats wrong
For some reason my keyboard glitches every time I use it in this app 
I end up having to restart my phone just so the keyboard will minimize 
The app is fine as long as I dont want to tweet anything 
Love the semi material design 
Wish we could see more of that!
Its ok
Yeah Its Cool One   
Twitter is so amazing
It never freezes on me and keeps updated constantly 
Its verry cool and mind blowing
Doesnt let me change my header or bio 
Just says updating profile in my notification bar forever & doesnt go away 
Until I restart my phone 
The new layout doesnt look nice!!!
Please switch it back, it looked so much nicer 
There is this annoying bug where I cant reach some half of my tweets on my profile page 
If someone has favorited it, though, it is completely accessible through notifications panel 
THE FONT IS SO BIG PLEASE PUT BACK THE OLD FONT 
THE SMALL FONT
Does the job  
Its very good app
The app seems to get slower with every update 
Search takes an eternity, and just refreshing the time line takes longer than before 
Its also frustrating that you cant see all of someones tweets when you go to their profile - there are big time gaps between the tweets that do load 
For all the updates, its not getting better, just slowing down and offering less functionality   
One of my favorite apps
Is great but the app is slow now and takes forever to load videos or see others post by the hashtag 
Also the area to start a tweet is small so sometimes I accidentally press on the tweet in front of it and it is annoying 
Twitter needs some better adjustments 
Works everyday anyday anytime
Why Microphone acces 
What yall trying to do 
Thanks for the update
I think the Twitter app is brill I can interact with the subjects that are of interest to me and like minded people 
I cant see any recent tweets when I go to peoples profiles 
Just from days ago
Locked me out for no reason and I cant get back on 
We would all die without this app
Cant get enough 
So far its good no problem at all
Enjoy your new year
Finally learning how to use the app and Twitter :-) and enjoying it!
Most things work well and I have no problem with it but I dont understand how there isnt a quick way to go to my feed 
Sometimes I have to hit back a dozen times if I went on a little twitter journey 
Plenty of space of top for it 
Also, how many times do I have to say no to if I "liked that highlight" before it stops showing them to me
Its turning into Facebook with that crap and I dont use that anymore 
I just want to see tweets in order of time on my feed 
Its nice to share and update 
It works for me 
Its good!!
Its a great app and all but it keeps crashing again and again    I have to uninstall and install it once again 
Thats really annoying, fix please 
Why favourite button does not exist on my twitter pleasee
The flow is great and your Twitter is never boring due to the activity section
Great on phone and tablet 
Third party photo service 
Shortener for URL 
Mko isss mai verification code snd hi nhi krtai plzzz snd me verification code plzzz
I havent been able to access my twitter through the app for the past 5 hours 
Had a bug, the update fixed it 
this is like a good app so get it and because its a good way to keep in touch with people
Keep discover and activity !
Bad new update and photo show and it became silly when making retweets
The lists tab no longer displays any lists 
Anything can be improved but I have no complaints 
Works very well 
This app is still not working, with no tweets showing in my timeline 
Sometimes pictures will not load regardless if im on 4G or Wifi 
Everything else is fine 
Best app love it
Wheres the top bar gone!
Was good app had no problems until top bar went missing
Hard to know what the symbols mean
Always use it    Great app
Its so good x
Stalk the famous and avoid real life 
It wont tell me when I receive a DM
Does what it says
The only thing I hate is how I accept the followers requests and I go out to check the feed but when look at the followerss requests again, the same followers request are still there!
They NEVER go away, it always shows that I have a certain amount of follower requests which I had accepted before 
It is irritating 
Now I have the Lg G3 but before I had an iphone, and the same exact thing used to happen on the iphone 
Does all I need 
Dont know why people moan so much 
Yall needa fix this app yall bugging man 
Recommends people I dont want to see
How to deactivate it i jst maked it by mistake
ALL I CAN IN MY TLIST IS ONLY MY TWEETS 
I CANT SEE TWEETS OF MY FOLLOWINGS 
I cant retweet 
Yersh    just yersh
Does not download
What happened to my notification bar
Im not getting no information youll need to fix this
I like this app   but why it often updating the same issue
There is a problem with twitter every time I open it 
It hangs my phone so please focus on this issue 
This is good application 
It wont let me save my profile fix an ill rate 5 stars
The older version is better
