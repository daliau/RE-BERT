I am loving my Kindle Fire Hd and accessories we got for it!Its great for my email and reading books 
I didnt think I would like it as much as my husband loves his year old Kindle Fire, but I do 
I decorated my black cover with some pretty stickers of crystals!
Like being able to keep up with facebook when I travel 
Its not exactly the same as playing on your home computer but you are able to stay in touch 
This is great  
I dont have to get on my computer to see FB, helps me to keep up with whats going on , love it 
Wont load peoples pages, freezes when I try to watch a video, I have to force close the app when I look at pictures, and news feed doesnt lead 
Please fix these things 
It works great if you are just lurking 
When using the new updated Kindle version, heaven help you 
At some point, you will type something that contains a friend or liked interest and you will not be able to type what you intended to 
I guess when I actually need to post something, I will need to go pick up my iPhone 
This app worked ok beyond some glitches but forced me to update even though I tried before and it didnt work and more it wont even open 
I love it jus like a pc very easy to log in and out enjoy friends and meet new ones along with family and classmates would reccomend to everyone
I can check in from anywhere my Kindle takes me 
Would be better if it had more of the features you get on the website on the pc 
no better way to stay caught up with your friends on FB, easy to use, a good app 
could use some tweaks but overall solid 
I have used this app for most of the year, but as of yesterday I have not been able to get past login blue screen 
Either this is virus attacking itself only to this app or it is a very bad update 
As it is not only men and not every app on my kindle, I wonder 
Other Facebook applications are hard to work with, one can not find the commands, the page freezes, or one can get lost and find it difficult to return to original screan - This App -WORKS!
Facebook helps you keep in touch with friends that otherwise would be literally impossible to stay in touch with 
The games are also challenging and very addicting 
alot of time it is not responding  which is very frustratingI get tired waiting to be able to continue my work
Cruising along on FB when all of a sudden, I cannot open it anymore 
Tried all the things from other posts but still stuck in FB/kindle gridlock 
Opens on silk just fine 
the app is responsive but one problem when sending a message to someone the plus nd smokey face Icon for sending images is their but when I press it no options for pics or stickers to send comes up not a major problem to me although to some people probably yes fixxxxx asap
I never thought that I d be on face book, my grand kids put me out there and now I enjoy reading what theyre doing 
pictures are great since picture taking and developing is getting to be a thing of the past, cell phones hold their pictures 
It logs you on and is usually stable 
My main issue is that the App feels very cramped like they were trying to fit so much into it that they ran out of space 
The pictures that appear on my timeline take up the entire screen and are not automatically sized down 
I did have it freeze on me a couple of times and I thought it was going to crash, but it managed to recover 
If they can make it so your photos dont take up the entire screen and fix the freezing issues, it would be a little more useful 
As it is, I still have it on my Kindle Fire, but I rarely use it 
That is my biggest gripe, along with not being able to show my jewelry on my timeline   have to use a business page which most people dont go to often!
This just does not work properly with the Kindle Fire 
Its so bad, that its clearly obvious that the author of the software and the person who approved its release for the Fire has never ever actually loaded it and run it on a Fire 
I wish I could rate this with negative stars, because its just that terrible 
July 9 ,2014 update has made this app unusable 
I can not open it 
I have deleted the a pop and reinstalled it several times 
Thanks update, job well done         Not!
this face book works great on my htc phone but didnt work on my kindle fire hd 8 9  
it keeps glitching 
i had to get the facebook that had the fb  facebook for kindle fire hd  for it  
so if this dont work for you try looking for one that works just for your device  
I like the social aspect of it but, sometimes the privacy sttings are confusing 
For the most part it is easy 
Its the same facebook 
To me theres nothing different 
I use it when I dont feel like getting up to check my FB 
Plus you get messages instantly 
After the first 10 or so posts the rest just load as blue text without pictures and it doesnt change after refresh 
This doesnt happen on my news feed but does on groups and pages 
the only posts that show up on the kindle fire app are whatever they decide to show 
there is no way of searching new posts or most recent 
Some I get are 2 days old!
How do I use the new update I cant even find my own profile or any settings anymore
What the crap
In my opinion I think this is someplace for people to gossip 
I only go on it when it is necessary 
The Facebook app can be very helpful keeping up with your facebook 
But it also malfunctions a lot sometimes 
But other than that the app is dependable and could probably use an update 
This is a great app   it is big and beautiful with large pictures and all the features from the desktop version!
This app is a must have!
its great except i miss things because the news feed wont load prior events, and i cant check facebook all day
you keep connected to the outside world learn a lot about people get to to see family and friends pictures help out something to bebefit others good recipes ect 
This application is good for adult and teens it was download by my nice but my kids dont have a password but is good for mammy I got my Facebook and its great to be in contact with my family
i hate the fact that on the kindle you cant send voice messages, when it has a speaker!
I am new and often feel unclear on using different areas and getting simple instructions seems far too complicated 
Where does one find FaceBook for Dummies
i picked 5 stars because facebook is the best i have found many friends and relatives i havent seen in years how can you beat that i am hook on facebook should have been on  it sooner 
It works well on my Kindle 
I like the way that it looks 
I like how smooth it runs 
I use my kindle for every thing I use on my laptop 
I never go ANYWHERE without my Kindle in my purse 
For me this app is completely useless!!!
Why doesnt it download and work like any other app
I just want to use it like any other, and I cant 
App wont install completely 
Keeps showing &amp;#34;install failed&amp;#34; 
Requires additional steps now for me to access Facebook 
I like Facebook for the Kindle Fire 
I use it all the time 
There are more options available to you if you use a PC or Mac instead 
However, this app still retains a lot of the features that I use most often; for example, event info, news feed stories, photo album viewing, videos, etc 
Facebook games do not work in this version of Facebook; you would need an actual computer for that 
I like the layout of the application, but I like my applkication posts hidden once I have viewed them 
I give this a 3 rating as you cannot hide posts in your newsfeed 
Add this and I may give it a 4 star 
I am glad kindle has an application 
I do wish the kindle worked more like my Iphone tho 
Appreciated how quickly I was able to put it on my kindle 
Defintely worth downloading 
Um yea, new layout is ugly, where do I see notifications
How can I get to my own profile, events, friends, everything!
How do I get to messages!
Very bad update 
Word of advice: if it isnt broken, DONT FIX IT!
The pictures are so big that it is more than annoying, and is an irritant 
Cant do highlight, copy, then paste 
I would consider it barely functional, but there are few choices available so you really have no choice 
I can only access the latest 6 news feed entries at any one time 
I dont actually bother using it on the Kindle now 
My Android version is much more convenient 
fix this app 
as others have said, it only loads the first few posts in the news feed 
i have gone back to using this app on my android phone because it works just fine on it 
but it sure would be a lot nicer if it would work on my much larger-screened kindle fire hd   just please fix it 
just getting used to it
think its great a wonderful way to connect with friends,i like th new look,keep up the good work its the best 
I flipping love this 
its absolutely the best app on the market 
I would absolutely positively reccomend to anyone I know!
I can get on Facebook with this app 
What more does one need with it
Plus its free 
SO there ya go 
Im sorry but this app is just crap 
I have only got the app load once 
Looks like others are having similar issues 
This app worked fine by my standards 
Its the typical Facebook app for most devices, easy to use for me 
I use this nearly everyday since we only have one computer and my wife is on it a lot 
Facebook is how we talk back and forth with our grandkids and friends since they are in another state 
same as the other fb hopefully time will fix it will try again another day and hope its fixed, i love fb
Works surprisingly well than my phone 
Very smooth and excellent for stalking your buddies online Its free, works better than most devices, whats not to like
Comprehensive one roof many thoughts,Games,Feelings, sharing, the best platform for meeting people Easy  to associate with other applications  like I use to post my links from Fotopedia 
This is really great, I can stay in contact with family and friends 
Also put my view points and daily word on Face book 
I can also view pictures of family and friends 
Love the app 
You can get on very quickly to Facebook with this app 
I would highly recommend this app 
i have trouble with the posts loading 
it shows about 10, then tends to freeze up 
it is very frustrating
When I open the app it keeps reinstalling itself over and over again please fix it today its going to make the masses hate you if you dont
I know that I need to get a life when I check my Facebook daily 
I do enjoy it tho 
Its connected me to people I havent heard from in years!
Seems easy to use on my tablet 
I am still trying to figure everything out on this tablet 
I am conquering the learning curve 
I was introduced to facebook almost ten years ago 
In the beginning, I could not get enough of it 
I enjoyed some of the new games they have put on such as nfl trivia 
Even at twenty seven years old, I still check on lives of old friends 
cant see more than a few posts then the spinning circle of death at the bottom of the screen 
most others with same problem
Love watching my family and friends out of state
works very well and is essential for the Facebook junkie 
I think messenger is included for quasi private emails 
Its free!
Not a bad app but so skeletal its frustrating 
Cannot adjust news feed for &amp;#34;most recent&amp;#34; vs  &amp;#34;top stories&amp;#34; 
Cannot mark notifications as read 
Cannot see entire photo album from news feed 
Missing functionality in messaging &amp; events 
Constantly wants to update but updates fail 
Fine off you want Facebook without using web browser, but definitely sub-par when compared to web version 
I really do like Facebook a lotLike I get to see other people some of them be my family some be friends Facebook is very awesome
I love it!
It helps me to stay in touch with family [especially those living out of state] and friends 
At first I would see a handful of posts, and then another handful listed underneath in shaded boxes that you cant access 
Now I dont have the boxes anymore, but it only lets me scroll down so far and stops 
So if you want to access something beyond that, you cant 
Pretty useless unless youre only interested in the past few days 
Im beginning to think the devs dont care about fixing it either 
Save yourself the trouble and just access Facebook through your browser 
The newsfeed only shows a few posts, then there are these weird blue blocks that you cant even click 
Id rather not even use the app because of this 
Hopefully it will be fixed with an update soon 
The app no longer loads properly since I downloaded the update 
Until the problem is fixed I will be without access to Facebook and therefore unable to communicate properly with friends and family 
Because I have limited eyesight I prefer facebook on my Mac over my Iphone or Kindle fire 
Facebook keeps changing things I like about it and it frustrates me 
I cannot seem to ever get a Facebook session running without seeing &#34;error loading story&#34; message 
So many times Im tired of even trying to use FB on my Motorola Razr HD 
Seems like they have more work to do to create a compelling FB phone app 
Expected more from an app 
for a tablet 
Same as a smartphone    Disappointed, need to get with increasing the quality for an app 
for a larger device
Updated version will not open!!
I see others are having this problem too 
How frustrating :( Hope its fixed soon 
back to using it on my phone
easy to download and use everything is there at your fingertips and the pics look awesome in HD just perfect
Its Facebook 
But some things cant be seen with a mobile app 
Dont know if thats this app, or all of them 
The full news feed and peoples time lines will not load all the way 
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE FIX 
Seems to be a wide spread problem 
DAMN fix already 
Though this is the full Facebook app, it tends to lag behind in updates 
Perhaps, a better relationship with developers would help 
Helps me keep up with friends and family 
Wish people would keep their political views to themselves, though 
This should be for fun and information 
This app is ok, but its not as nice as the feel on a PC 
I have a kindle HD 8 9, and I know the look/feel can be better than it is, given the size of my device 
This is easy to download 
You can also apply to be a Beta tester for tablets if you want too 
The graphics are nice and works well on our tablet 
Worth the time to get 
its facebook and it works 
no problems downloading or using the app 
not really much more to say about that 
very difficulte to use 
jumps to the top when you back out of a posting and will not give a friends complete list
Happy to be able to get on FB and check things from my new Kindle Fire HD 
Easy to get on using the FB App 
Although this is my Facebook client of choice,  it hasnt ever been great 
So if you are willing to settle for mostly good enough, then this is the application for you 
Im happy with facebook on my kindle and I like to follow my grandchildren on facebook and my friends too
Much better, facebook was not very good without 
Now I can look at more post before it only showed a few posts 
I love how easy it is to connect with (old) long time friends, and family, I have learned a lot of interesting things 
I love have this app 
I check it a few times a day 
Simple and easy to use!
please fix the facebook application on kindle fire so it can work right 
when I sign on and it sits there loading for ever and when I click on the tab on the top it loads my messages just fine 
I love to read the gossip that everyone shares 
I especially love the pictures of my friends & family that are shared
The site does not have enough privacy protection -- I do not want the entire world to know (my personal information or what I share with my friends) -- only my friends ---- plus I do not like the options that protect the sharing and posting functions -- options need to have conditions such as only with my friends or open to all 
On my Kindle Fire HD this app is ok 
When something is posted that has a link and you click on it, it takes you to a Web page, but theres no way to get back to Facebook without hitting home and going back to the app 
So mildly annoying 
This is the best method I have found to stay in touch with my friends and family 
From all around the world we can communicate 
I just updated and now my app doesnt work at all!
It just says &quot;Facebook has stopped&quot; every time I open it 
this is grate not sure why people are complaint about this app 
not enough words to post my review well now I can
on my kindle fire this is the only way I have to post photos on facebook now since facebooks last stupid change to their uploading 
kindles browser doesnt support whatever new process facebook uses now 
to upload I download the pic I want to post, go to the kindle gallery, select the pic, hit menu, hit share, then choose this facebook program 
Easy way to view family and friends, their pictures especially and their interests 
Life is so hectic, it is becoming more difficult to stay in touch, especially when living further and further apart 
I recommend facebook to those who like to stay connected on a more personal level
I am very pleased with this app 
It is very easy to use and very fast 
I use it quite often!
what can I say  Facebook is  facebook  either you love it or you dont  
I like the older versions best 
Whats to like or not like about the app 
It works and thats all that matters 
Facebook is what it is 
I hate they keep changing the look even of MY page without my consent 
Post often dont show when they should 
Most recently, they took money from my checking account without my permission 
I havent checked yet to see if it has been put back in 
Too often Ive had scammers trying to be friends on hijacked accounts 
I only have this to try and promote my work 
I could continue this rant, but I wont 
I like having access to Facebook, but Im so disappointed that I cant play my Facebook games on my Kindle 
As a facebook addict, this app is obviously awesome for those who want to stay connected to facebook 
Im glad its offered for the kindle fire b/c I would be pretty disappointed if I had this sweet e-reader/tablet and couldnt get onto my facebook 
I do wish there was a better(any) alert system like on your iPhone for when you get new alerts(comments, likes, messages) 
But I guess thats alright b/c being that my kindle doesnt ding when I get an alert my iPhone WILL so if I want to use my kindle I still can b/c my iPhone will alert me and then instead of using it to get on FB I just get on my kindle instead 
This app is the worst 
You cant even watch a video for 2 seconds 
It always force close 
The new update wasnt worth it 
Slow to load on smart phone and desktop PC 
Search incomplete and complicated 
Changing the background takes forever 
I didnt really care for this facebook app 
On my phone it will let you look at status etc for as long you want to scroll down, but the app wouldnt only let me look and then it wouldnt bring up anything else 
So I just started going to the web and looking at FB on there 
I havent been able to post for awhile now 
Whats the point of the app if all you can do is read 
You should be able to do better 
Stop wasting time collecting and analyzing usage and make an app that works 
Facebook for the Kindle Fire HD is behind in features and function contained in the iPhone 
It works well but seems behind in the iPhone app a bit 
I like the ease of uploading phptps to my facebook page from my gallery 
I do not stay logged in all the time as I do not like to get notifacations all the time
Facebook is facebook, I wish they had a dislike button 
Why am I even rating this 
Its only the number social media sites 
The app appeared to have downloaded but when I open the app it closes 
Definitely does not work 
Glad it was free 
Like it well enough for staying in the loop with family and friends 
Recommend it to family and friends 
Can also download and print posted photos!
APP WORKS FINE, JUST NEED TO FIND SOMEONE TO SHOW BE HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF FACEBOOK, NEVER SURE WHERE I AM OR WHERE IAM GOING 
NOT AN ISSUE WITH THE APP BUT FACEBOOK ITSELF 
it helps me keep in touch with my kids and grandkids 
dont like the ever changing stuff when i get used to it you all change it but im hanging in there
It facebook run great let you hook up to existing accounts really well it is  well 
I can  say that it was easy to install and use 
Let me hook up with family and friends 
Been on for quite awhile Like keeping up with family 
Have alot of problems with the games 
Can be very aggrevating 
Its ok but if u want to block sum one u cant unless there ur friend 
But I still like it an I reported sexually explicit an it came back as a negative it dont have sexual explicit 
Since this morning I havent been able to open Facebook 
It loads for awhile then shuts off 
And I uninstalled it but it keeps reinstalling itself 
It is very annoying!
Fixing it is a must
This app is absolutely great!
It allows me to talk ti my friends while in completely different places, almost like the computer version 
The Facebook app most recent update forces you to view your timeline in Top Stories format 
You no longer have the option to view your timeline in Most Recent order 
Its worthless now 
You are better off pulling up Facebook in the Silk web browser 
Or, just dumping Facebook since the obviously dont care what the customers want 
I  use a Kindle Fire HDX 
There is no way to switch from Most recent to Top stories 
The notification center doesnt work 
And, I can no longer get to my groups or favorites 
This newest version is AWFUL and ANTIQUATED!!!
I would give it zero stars, if possible!!!
