if you dont have this in your library for apps then you need to get it today is one app that I would get 
To be honest I would tell everybody I know to get it to complete their movie experience!!!!
out of no where the video will freeze up for a few minutes then after that it will force close 
I have to go through that a couple of times but other than that it is very great (:
awesome app but first you have to log out and in but still awesome app you should get it it is great
I have been a member of Netflix for several years 
I enjoy the service and they have an excellent selection and wide variety of movies and shows 
I havent really used this yet, I have been just streaming free shows and movies from my kindle fire 
We shall see 
i love netflex it is awesome it works VERY well i love it i watch all my movies nd shows on this its better than red box or hulu but tht is my opinion
Love it Love it 
Did I say I love 
I got a Roku1 and watched a couple things on my 50 inch screen TV 
That was great 
I did have it free on my once during a movie 
I checked the internet connection, which was fine and it restarted ok 
Have watched tons of things on my fire taplet and my Iphone 
Very entertaining when I am bored 
Im rather disappointed in that I cannot arrange and re arrange my queue 
This app is basically allowing the user to stream a movie 
Thats nice, but I would really like more 
i dont know why i keep the service honestly 
i am constantly frustrated by the lack of material available on the streaming plan    ESPECIALLY when it says that the disc is availablce!
i have an idea    how bout you burn that onto your servers and make it available
the lack of availability on streaming doesnt make me want to upgrade, it just pisses me off 
Device limitations, I pay for it and dont even watch it because it has nothing I like on it 
My daughter started to pay for it because I was going to discontinue it, so if that tells you anything       You can only use two devices at a time and that really sucks 
I love the season of TV shows they have 
Am watching Supernatural that has 7 seasons 
They keep it updated 
There is 7 seasons and the show just got done with season 8 
And there are alot of shows that had only 1 season 
They are rated good, too bad they only ran for 1 season 
Alot of choices!!
Reasonable price for streaming!!
Was a decent app now no video and frequent errors 
This must be fixed soon or I will  end my service
it works good and is a good app 
until it glitches out and doesnt work on your kindle anymore 
even if you reinstall it doesnt work 
enjoy it while it lasts 
Needs more variety in newer movies 
Also some foreign newbies would be interesting 
I prefer to join periodically rather then continuous to allow them to build up a new supply of movies 
its a really cool app most of the time but I hats when it wont load so I uninstalles it with the plans of reinstalling it to see if it could get off the title page but now I cant reinstall it for whatever reason and it makes me really mad :l so then I try to search it on the appstore since it wont let me reinstall it on the homepage that dosent work either ANDNOWIWANTTOSCREAMIHATETHISIHATETHISTHATETHISBUTIREALLWISHITWOUKDWORK
Netflix is great you can watch movies on the with your phone, kindle fire or your computer , laptop or just sitting at home!
Its very affordable and kids love it !
Its the best thing you can buy because every one in the family can watch what they like 
Try it you love it :)
App works real well 
It sometimes hangs and I have had to shut down and restart my Kindle Fire 
I do like being able to control the volume from within the app 
I also like the 10 second rewind button 
I enjoy watching all the genres available 
One can choose from documentaries, TV shows both old and current, movies and biographies 
My grandchild loves to watch her shows and I can catch my favorites without commercial interruption 
I have a Netflix subscription for home use and found that when I want to catch up on an old television series or movie, it was great to have it on my Kindle and take it to the gym and watch it while Im on the treadmill 
40-45 minutes flew by while jogging!
If I pause a movie and come back to it later then it only plays sound and a black screen 
To fix the problem I have to uninstall the app   turn the kindle off   turn back on   then reinstall the app 
Netflix works on iPhone, Samsung tablet, and home computer with no problems   just having problems with Netflix on kindle fire 
This is the one app that, without fail, gets used in our house EVERYDAY!
If one of my children arent watching something on their Kindle Fires with Netflix, then my husband or I are 
This app allows you to quickly and easily access Netflix content that is available for streaming 
My kids have all but given up on watching television, as they can watch what they want when they want on Netflix 
I highly recommend this app 
The best part is its FREE 
Thanks to this app I can watch Netflix on my Pandigital tablet 
It did not come preloaded like it is on other tablets, I am very happy with this app 
I watched my first program on Netflix yesterday 
It was amazing and I was able to contol it just like on television 
i can not wait to watch my next program 
Great having all the movies you like at the top of your fingers 
One price and watch all you want 
this is by far easier than Amazon PRime  interms of streaming options ie we can stream at  3 gb/hour versus HD ONLY at 1-2 3 GB 
I have netflix on my phone and computer but now that i have it on my kindle fire it gives me a reason to workout longer at the gym!
I like Netflix but I wish they would submit less violent movies 
I enjoy comedy and mystery but not as much violence 
We have used Netflix for a couple of years but just recently started watching it on our portable devices since it can be watched on anything with an internet connection Internet speeds do not have to be as fast with Netflix as they do with Amazon Prime 
The app worked generally as expected the first launch But today it required that I log in again (why I was logged out is unknown) then crashes after a login timeout 
Its unusable at the moment 
Has new movie best seletion of TV shows update everyday  and the best thing of is I can see it any where
I have not had the other issues that other reviewers mentioned 
This app works very well for me 
There are so many choices for everyones liking and the the fact you can watch as many as you want for a very small monthly fee is awesome and you can watch from just about any device where you have internet 
Anyone who loves watching movies or tv series should subscribe 
Five star all the way 
Thank you netflix
Same old movies 
They dont add any NEW movies 
I would like to see more new movies 
I cant get it to work properly on my tablet 
It continues to give me constant error messages then restarts my browser 
I hats it 
Good catalogue and good service 
Ive been a Netflix customer for many years and its fantastic and the app works great on the Kindle Fire 
I should not do this review because I havent used this yet 
I may decide not to use it because I dont want 2 netflix bills!
A great alternative to paying the high prices for pay channels 
I can pick and choose what I want to watch and when I want to watch it 
Have no problems here 
Works great, looks great (with decent signal, of course) 
If you are having issues with the app on kindle fire then post your review on the kindle fire app version!
Netflix has a huge variety of programs to choose from right at your finger tips and at an amazing cost 
My family loves Netflix!!
It has never given us problems on our Kindle Fire 
The only thing we tend to forget about is not being in a wi-fi spot!
It works well on my Kindle Fire 
Its nice to be able to start watching on my Kindle something I stopped watching on my TV 
sound is in sync 
very good app 
they updated it so now the grey tab bar is gone 
video quality is great it just takes a second 
This is a great app!
This app allows you to bring netflix where ever you go!
The videos load very fast and look good!
The sound is great depending on the device you have 
The only downside to this app is you do need to acess the internet to watch the videos 
I down loaded it by mistake 
I have no interest in Netflix 
I will read it next time 
Thanks any way 
netflix sucks and isnt the best for a kindle fire you shouldnt waste your money on it trust me!!!!!!!
I only gave it one star
My daughter has this on her Nabi Tablet and it keeps her busy after homework time of course 
Lots of things to choose from for her to watch,
very convenient to have mobile
Works just like it does on the tv 
If you have problems with the app just shut down your kindle and turn it back on 
When i first reviewed Netflix on the kindle fire i gave it only 3 stars because of serious audio issues with the player but they have since patched it and it works perfectly now, they even got rid of the black bar at the bottom of the screen   so good job Netflix!
Im so pleased that Netflix is available for the iphone 
It is easy to use and always there when I want it 
have had Netflix for a long time also get so of my movie from them great deal great movie A
The app works great for me with a couple exceptions 
Scrolling through movies is a chore as sometimes the row wont scroll when you touch it and once in awhile it says cannot retrieve info and will make me log back in 
Knock on wood it always accepts my password and I am back up and running 
I love this app and recommend it if you have a netflix account and a device 
Sometimes the choice of movies leave a great deal to be desired but now that I have found the Korean movies, especially the TV series by Studio 15, we have some very fine story lines and acting 
They are movies you can watch with the family and not be embarassed 
Chong Parks music is delightful 
I was brought up being told I was Irish American but secretly I believe I am Korean 
Ive had Netflix for many years, now that they are producing their own original content, it has only gotten better 
I would love it if they had a little more updated movies
I chose to rate Netflix with 5 stars because I enjoy the varied options to choose between TV shows (especially those out of the UK and Austrailia), movies that build on faith and values which can be watched with any member of the family, and the ease of use I recommend it to those who tend to those who prefer less sex and violence 
I also recommend it to those who enjoy a good movie / program with a message for the good 
For the price you cant beat it you can watch just about anything although some things I looked for were not available 
I think they have improved a great deal 
The app works fine, but Netflix doesnt have much to offer 
There are no commercials and that is a plus over Hulu, but it doesnt have enough recognizable movies 
Everything is either old or unheard of 
I can watch TV shows that missed, but not all of them 
It does stream movies smoother if you have a slower modem, unlike Hulu 
I still ended up getting a faster modem 
I have no problem with Amazon, however 
They are great 
Love it, love it, love it    
I put this app on my Kindle Fire and have been enjoying it ever since 
If you are familiar with Netflix then think &#34;Netflix portable&#34; 
I bought a cheap set of earphones with a 3 cord and now I can walk around anywhere my WiFi reaches while watching what I choose This added a whole new dimension to my Kindle Fire 
its great app its very useful you can watch your favorite movies and TV shows at your disposal its something the whole family can use
It is cheaper than Netflix and hey    you get free shipping on most of the things you buy!
I used to have both, but I found that both services have about the same movies 
It works great 
It keeps my kids happy while I work 
Very little loading time and great picture
I am using this app on my kindle fire 
The only issue I am having is the audio is a little off from the video 
By off, I mean only by seconds 
Picture quality is great, and I am not having the issue with the border staying on the screen 
Over all I am very pleased 
Almost all of the movie and t v  show options for the adults like me with an array of action, suspense, and at rare occasions the horror movie fix option is always there, too 
What the best part is the customer ratings that a video store never was able to provide as well as the Netflix option to rate movies and then have recommended films and shows for the future entertainment 
Also there are plenty of childrens movies and programs except with my disappointment no Star Wars materials 
Overall, the best area now that will give the best deals for t v  and movies 
For 8 00 dollars a month it is not a bad deal 
Plays well on the Kindle Fire and will probably do even better on the newer Kindle Fire soon to be released 
What an amazing deal 
May go ahead and STOP my cable and just use neflix 
Great selection, and easy to stream to ALL my machines
whats not to like
Its netflix Its super awesome and is better than cable 
seriously, whats not to like dude
the people who said it is really bad are wrong 
although there are some bugs it is still great!
you should get this!
Has alot of great shows!
full seasonsgood genres, I would give 5 stars exceptthey are a little behind on getting some of the latest seasons
Now I can watch my favorite shows on the run as long as I have WiFi minor issues with picture at times might be operator error
I love all the options you have to pick from!
Great for the entire Family at home and vacation 
To me a free trial does NOT involve my credit card 
A free trial means that I try it for free and if I like it I THEN provide my credit card 
Im enjoying all the excellent series that Netflix has and the time saved by eliminating commercials or browsing thru the TV schedule 
I only wanted this App on my phone to check my account, etc 
I did not want a free trial, as I already have an account and do no streaming, just DVDs 
Now I cant get a response from Netflix and will probably be paying double for something I dont even use 
i always go on Netflix and watch tv shows and movies sometimes it buffers but i still LOVE IT SO MUCH&#60;3
Works as it should 
Allows to add and delete streaming movies and shows to list 
No complaints as of yet 
Works great if you have a netflix account 
Quality is what it should be & you need it(the app)to play shows from netflix 
works on android 2 2 with out issues 
The app is trying to talk with my smart TV 
If I did not have it on the TV allready I would have tried it out 
I am unfamiliar with how to use this app and what it offers and instructions on how ti activeate it 
Okay so I was wantin to get Netflix on my kindle fire cause I have it on my desktop,laptop, Wii, and playstation 3 but half of the review say the video lags and sound quilty is horrible and all that but Im gonna get it and try it cause ive read if you have an updated kindle fire and charter Internet it works just fine which I have both so I will give this another review after having it a while 
Very convenient can use it on my kindleEnjoy the tv series options  
I can watch what I want to while others are watching what they want
Particularly for the HD Kindle, this is like having a movie theater right in the palm of your hands 
Less clunky than a a laptop, easy, convenient, and looks and sounds great!
YOU NEED THIS for your Kindle!
Every once in a while, I have issues getting this to load on my kindle; shutting it down and restarting does not fix the problem 
Frustrating because Im paying for the subscription to Netflix 
I love netflix 
I love that I can stream movies and certain tv shows when I feel like watching them 
Or catching up on tv shows that I havent been able to watch 
The netflix app is fantastic on my kindle and I have NO complaints with it 
I have a kindle fire HD and I didnt want to buy or rent any movies from prime    so they finally have it for kindle 
Sometimes the picture its all the clear but I really like Netflix app!!
i tryed  and tryed to get my app store to work and all needed to do is put the right password for my amzon account and presto, the download worked 
When I first bought the original kindle fire this app wasnt too good 
but now I love it!
Anytime i want to catch a breather from my work on campus I pull out my kindle and watch a few tv shows or a movie 
I think this app is cool because u get to pick a favorote T V show 
and watch it 
tis is so cool to have this app
Definitely happy Im able to watch Netflix on my Kindle Fire!
Love it so much and would recommend it to anyone 
Netflix is wat i recommend to all the movie lovers out there  i watch movies on Netflix every day with the best picture quality ever
Handy application on my Android 
I can choose my evening movies while away from my TV 
It is convient and pracitical 
If you have a Netflix account, youve gotta get this app, It is free, and you can watch whatever Netflix offers wherever you happen to be 
Netflix just updated on my Kindle Fire 
They embedded a volume bar into the app which is a nice upgrade 
However the video and audio are still choppy 
i would have fixed that before making embedded volume a priority 
Newer releases sooner, to long between blu-ray release and streaming 
Should be able to stream and not wait two to three years 
I spend a lot of time watching movies or old tv shows, so any type of movie/tv app rocks for me 
Netflix has been the old standby and got me through quite awhile of basic cable and spent many hours of watching Dr  Who 
The price of Netflix is still quite reasonable and I can use the Netflix app on my Kindle Fire HD, my Laptop (not so good with crappy speakers - but will work in pinch), my husbands computer, or my husband one a new DVD player with surround sound that came with Netflix installed (havent tried that yet)  As far as the Kindle app goes it works great
Excellent, very easy to find what you want and I think the &#34;films like       &#34; that shows movies or programmes similar to the ones youve watched is a great idea 
I am not a TV fan 
Nor do I own a Boob tube (tv) 
Its a time waster 
Netflix is The Best!
By this time I would have thought Netfix would have created a more robust app for viewing their content 
Its look and feel is very basic 
What I dont like is that I cant update my DVD queue from the mobile app 
I llike the new profile management, but I it needs to be expanded to provide better parental controls 
The best thing about this is that its free 
This app fulfills every promise it makes and has a convenient user interface that is similar to the actual Netflix website 
I can count on one hand how many times it has had to buffer even though many other apps on the Kindle move slowly 
I rated netflix with 3 stars!!
They do not put enough new movies as often as I would like 
To many older movies all the time 
I do love the price and the TV show selections 
Yeah again, only was able to watch on computer so now it awesome to catch my shows elsewhere as long as i can connect
Works well, no glitches so far 
User friendly app that loads quickly and well and is easy to navigate and find what you need 
Works great on my LG Esteem phone 
Just use a micro HDMI cable to connect it to your big screen TV and plug your phone charger in and enjoy 
Plus with Metro PCS I have an unlimited 4G data plan so I dont have to worry about being ripped off for streaming 
I love Netflix 
Using the app on Kindle Fire isnt always the best 
It runs ok but can freeze or load very slow at times 
Netflix on my Kindle Fire (1st gen) works well and is a great looking app 
The interface is intuitive and just adds another mobile device to continue watching my favorite shows 
I was slightly unenthusiastic at first,reading all the negative reviews 
However I have to admit that it was worth the effort 
Video stream was very good and at my home DSL wireless,as good as a Dvd player the bottom tool bar get minimized and it is not annoying at all Overall a good app for netflix movies 
Highly recommend it 
Just an app    not really working Netflix 
I dont have free internet and pay by the KB so cant use Netflix but thought this might offer an alternative 
Good way to watch TV 
You can choose shows from the menu and netflix tries to predict what shows you will like based on previous ratings 
My roommate really liked this feature because it was very accurate for her 
I probably havent ranked enough shows because Netflix has no clue what Id like to watch 
Some shows arent available 
The layout is really good but the functionality is awful on the transformer infinity 
It is so slow that it barely will scroll the screen 
Watching a movie is blurry for a while and clears up most of the time 
This doesnt happen on my POS LG phone or my PC 
I had been holding off on NetFlix for a while 
Now that I have it I barely watch TV anymore 
Better than the bargain-bin On-Demand choices I have with my local cable provider 
I love this  
i had to pay 10 dallor a mouth !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
my mom got so mad i got ground on my b day and got no present 
please sew them 
to the ground 
how is with me if u are 
put 1 star
It doesnt seem to run right on my tablet 
Its a Herotab C8 with Android 2 3 
But none of the versions seem to work right 
Maybe time for a new tablet 
sync issues with audio and severe video lag 
I wonder if this is done on purpose to force consumers to pay for the premier service
our whole family loves Netflix 
We have a special needs son that can watch appropriate television anytime he wants to and the availability of it makes it a terrific reward system 
We also have a typical  child that enjoys a wide variety of television and movies 
It is perfect for him as well 
We love Netflix 
Netflix has so many free choices for TV shows and movies 
They keep track of what youve watched and, even after a lot of time, you can start your show where you left off 
So much easier to navigate than Amazon 
I struggle to find what I want on Amazon and usually give up 
On Netflix, there is a list of what Ive watched recently plus I can just type it in a bar and it comes up if they have it 
It is so frustrating to navigate Amazon to even get to their videos whats more find one to watch 
I bought my Kindle Fire when they first came out 
Recently, I have been bringing my Fire to work so I can watch some shows while on my lunch break 
I sat down today to continue watching my show when I opened the Netflix app, or I should say that I tried to open the app, but a connection error popped up 
I then checked other apps, they are working properly, so I decided to delete and reinstall the app 
Well, turns out my Kindle Fire is no longer supported 
I am not sure who to place the blame on since the app was working perfectly up until today 
But I am severely disappointed to find that my device is no longer supported 
I only wonder if the Kindle Fire HD is next 
this is the best app but its a little fuzzy and stops every now and then its awesome and that is my review
the reason i dont give it 5 stars is only because i want even more movies right after they are out of theaters
I HAVE HAD NETFLIX FOR ABOUT 3 YEARS, JUST NOW ADDED IT TO A NEW DEVICE 
YES, I LIKE THAT I CAN WATCH MOST ANYTHING I WANT INSTANTLY, AND CAN GET DVDS QUICKLY IF THEY ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR INSTANT WATCHING 
AND EVEN OLD SHOWS THAT I LOVED YEARS AGO, LIKE QUINCY!
THE ONLY REASON FOR NOT GIVING IT 5 STARS IS THAT I GOT HOOKED ON THE SHOW REVOLUTION, AND I HAVE WATCHED ALL THE EPISODES IN SEASON 1, BUT SEASON 2 IS NOT AVAILABLE YET!
I LOVE THIS APP, dont believe those people who say it has terrible video quality,and ext 
This is a GREAT app but if your gonna complain about it then dont get it, its not a perfect but neither is any other app, it could be fixed but it is great
I hats this app!
everytime I decide to watch a movie, I cant find it on Netflix 
I dont typically watch stuff that should be hard to find either 
What is Blockbuster up to these days
I love Netflix streaming and it works fine everywhere else 
And the other video apps work fine on the Fire 
But Netflix currently has an audio sync problem that makes watching anything extremely difficult 
Really needs to be fixed 
The only fix Ive found is to watch subtitled films so you wont notice so much 01/09/12 - Update: Its fixed 
Works great and the selection of Netflix is still the best 
This was a smart purchase that has proven to be WONDERFUL for traveling!I did appreciate that I was permitted a free trial because I was leary of if it actually worked   or if the movies were oooooooold/boring or were of poor quality 
Im pleasantly surprised 
dont no how well Netflix will work on my kindle yet I just downloaded it today only cause it says its free I will say this I had it on my home tv had nothing but problems I hope 2 have better luck this time
