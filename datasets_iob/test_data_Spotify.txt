So if you like an artist itll change your station to better the selection but if you accidentally like someone you dont because you were trying to press the dislike button then youre kinda screwed 
They forgot to let you unlike someone so please fix 
Its wierd to go from smooth music to country out of no where 
Up until this recent update I had a search bar but now its not there anymore 
I have seen other people with same problem so hopeful they fix it soon 
Other than that premium is too expensive but still good app 
Everytime I try to use the app it doesnt respond and I keep reporting it but nothing 
I have to restart my phone to use it 
I pay $10 a month and this is the kind of service I get
Unless you purchase the premium version the annoying adds spoil it 
You can find so many songs and all good ones 
Without the adds definately 5 stars 
Quality is excellent 
Get annoying emails all the time and the unsubscribe link for them does not work
I did love this app but now since the last two updates it keeps shutting down whenever I open up another app 
I have a meditation app that I listen to while I play Spotify, it wont play simultaneously anymore with any other app please fix 
I have been a subscriber to the premium service for over a year now and had the free service for a year prior to that I am getting very frustrated, I have uninstalled and reinstalled several times the problem is getting worse!
Great selection of music and easy to find just what you want
Is it just me
Loading circle is not music 
Seems like all apps eventually turn to junk 
When Im trying  to log in with facebook  a message appears with: I tried to log in from another county   please,  give me support
The app wont let me log in 
It just constantly says its logging in but never actually logs in 
Works fine on computer though 
You guys should bring back the snow on spotify but instead let it be a optional thing and include a rain option
The music is so amazing but you need to pay for ad free music
None of the others have anything on Spotify!!!!!
Love the fact u can customize and listen offline ur play lists   also the up to date music you can Save instead of liking 
Its great theres just one problem         
when your playing a game on your android or apple device youve got the audio for the game over the top of the music 
Besides that its great
fix the search bar     keeps disappearing 
Love it so much fun to listen to!
It was good but I thought you could make your own playlist
The app is constantly telling me I am offline when I have Internet to be able to listen to music 
it constantly freezes on me and kicks me out of the app 
I like listening to the music on here but I am getting upset about the updates and problems that app is having 
I downloaded this, expecting a decent music streaming service like Spotify Desktop 
Boy, was I wrong!
First, you can only play songs in Shuffle play 
Okay, kinda weird, but whatever 
But then, you end up listening soley to Suggested Songs and wont let you skip more than a couple, so youre stuck listening to Bubblegum pop instead of the Classical music you wanted to listen to 
What I dont get is why its so limited, compared to the desktop version
I can just use the browser version on my phone anyway 
The least user friendly app Ive ever used
Fantastic love this app well worth up gradeing
Stops after 10 sec playback in a sudden with all tracks 
Turns out I had to clear all cache and memory in order to make it run again 
I loved the Spotify app until the recent updates 
The system is very slow now and screen touches lag 
Very disappointed thinking of cancelling subscription
I love this app 
you can play your favorite music for free 
wherever you are
I have been using it for almost 5months and its doing great   fantastic   tnx for the apps
Doesnt do it all the time  but verry annoying when it does 
Anyone else getting it
i just wish it doesnt need internet just like SoundCloud but this one is better
App will not load
I like it but the stations are not very good
While the app works great for the most part, the lock screen player rarely shows up and when it does usually only the skip button works, while the play/ pause button does not 
After my 7 days ended I couldnt play my music
Your login is horrible 
I want to use my email not username 
Can something be done about that
Trying to set an account up but says my email account is allready taken by someone 
Sort it out
There is a bug with the ads and the app will stay stuck on the ad and not play it 
Have to restart my phone to listen to music again
It doesnt really count as free if you cant choose which song you want to listen to 
Also you cant really open that menu for a song because the slider gets in the way 
Spotify used to display on my lock screen so I didnt have to unlock my phone just to change songs 
This was really useful during workouts 
Great you should get it
I love it
Remove the forced shuffle thing 
Love it been using for years
When I open this app it would fc then I would  open it again after that no issues I just have to do it every single day
when I put my email in it didnt accept it 
It was all right but after like 30 days asked me to buy premium pack after every song 
Thats all 
You pay to be a member but once your not a paying member, all the downloads you have they dont play as anymore 
So cool have to listen to music
My favorite music app 
Great sound quality and great diversity of music 
With the new update it doesnt have the thing at the bottom that shows the album artwork 
You cant skip to a certain part of the songs and you have to change songs manually 
Please fix this 
Used to work just fine 
Recently, I can have excellent WiFi connection and full bars and it wont load any online songs 
Please fix this 
Disapointed cause I got a new phone and now it will not work LG 22 c on lollipop 5 0
Becuase you guys have Dirty Work!!!
Can someone tell me if theres an app like Spotify that actually works
One that preferably doesnt say no internet connection when I definitely am connected to the internet 
I love this app it is free and amazing I go for runs so this app is for me
But its not better than soundcloud
How do I make it bill my at&t account
I want premiem but I dont have a credit card 
need answer please
   but with the constant updates, now it just crashes 
Love the fact I can listen to whatever I want ANY time     Update 
Changed the 5 stars to 2 because they still have not updated the Android app to include the running  app 
It was all good until I had to pay every month 
Like i aint doing that!
I understand you need a way to get more money and for the artists to not get cheated in a way 
But i hate it that i cant find an app where i can get free music!
It was great for a while 
Can only play shufle
Best music app out there, but they should really bring the price down!
Wish you could cast
I love being able to access millions of songs and creating my own playlist 
You cant choose which device the music is playing from anymore
It is so STUPID
Spotify used to be king when it came to features 
However lately, theyve been lacking 
Still no Chromecast support 
Also, Android wear support is extremely basic 
(And only works thanks to Google )
PlayStation support is amazing however 
Absolutely love it 
Hope we get wear support soon 
This app is great In all but please add a timer or sleep timer 
When I sleep I live to listen to music and it would be better if a timer was added 
Please add a feature search 
It takes 10 minutes to load the music when Im on fast Wi-Fi and have no trouble doing any other activities 
If I didnt have all my play lists created I could cancel immediately because the service is so bad 
There is no reason for it to be so slow!
Also, for some reason it un-downloaded my downloaded play lists 
My Grandkids Loved it
Its great but there are so many new songs out and they arent there but overall its awesome!!!
Since the last update this app has given me nothing but trouble, it freezes constantly and sometimes wont even open 
When I finally get it to work I cant use any other apps on my phone as it actually causes them to freeze also (they work fine when Spotify isnt on)!
Hate this app, its useless!
The title says most of it, the search feature (If not instantly failing) will take an eternity to load results 
Also will occasionally freeze the Galaxy S5 
I loved this app and used it all the time but was horrified this AM while listening to a random playlist I chose called Morning Buzz 
One of the songs by artist MariKKKopa was clearly hateful angry racist ranting 
I will no longer be a happy follower of playlists unless this artist is REMOVED 
I clicked on a song and it plays a whole different song
Just wish you could crate ringtones
With Premium acc is good, but if you dont have Premium, app is very horrible 
Really bad whenever its time to play an Ad 
I will almost always have to restart the app 
Good sound quality 
Still needs updating with more songs / artists bit other than that its great!
Its cool has ALL my favorite artist
I love it one thin I think the should add is a tempo/speed thing so you can listen at different speeds that would be cool
My search bar isnt working 
I just noticed it today 
Other than that, I love spotify 
I just need the search bar issue resolved 
I think a lot of us do 
Love it to bits ( Premium) but I have to restart my phone everytime
Spotify is a great app
Tired of shuffle playing
It is dead boaring
So easy and fast
The only thing bad is atlest give unlimited skips and play when ever you want to people who dont have premium
Good music display and audio!
Just have tried it yet!
WAY better then you Pandora 
It doesnt let you pick the song u want to listen to its just always on shuffle and I hate it
I was able to find all the old albums I used to have and listen to my 80s music again 
How come you cant have spotify at a certain age
All you just do is listen to music 
Since the new update, I cannot see the album art of local files on my phone
I love it much
I really want to download it but it said stopped pls fix it I think its a great music  downloader Ill give five if u guys fix it
Wheres the search button
Just the ads need to go
Please fix this!
The app tells me it is offline when I try to listen to music on my network data connection 
It only works on WiFi 
I have checked the settings to enable online use but this doesnt make any difference 
If I stop the app completely and login again it works until I stop using the app, then it just goes offline again 
Im going to cancel my Spotify membership as it is a waste of money because the app doesnt work 
And yes, Ive tried reinstalling it 
They could make us pay before we get it
Aint No Sunshine
Since my phone updated to lolipop the app crash each time I want to start it 
How do I search songs now
Not working with my Galaxy S6 Edge 
Wont accept my credentials
Spotify is great, i can listen to all the music I want away from the Internet 
The price is a bit much, but if you think about it, its less than buying a cd a month
Loved it so much I can get all my favorite songs from my favorite artists 
Previous version was great, now it takes like 30 seconds to open!!!
Please fix that or let us downgrade to previous update 
I cant search and add new songs,fix that!
Or I might go to Pandora, tidal, or beats app
This app is becoming more and more useless by the day 
Just works when it feels like it 
It is a whole new,and better,alternative to Pandora 
If Im playing it in my car on Bluetooth sometimes the song will stop 
Then a couple seconds later it starts again but goes like super speed and it sounds all crackly 
Also when playing in my car if I go into maps and have that on the screen eventually spotify stops playing and exits and I have to go back into the app again 
Please fix these given Im paying every month and not getting what I paid for 
Include lyrics option please!
I cant opem it 
It someumes freezes my phone 
And then tells me spotify stopped running
How to search I dont find it 
Only problem I have with the app is the inability to download music to an SD card, as I have limited internal storage space 
All you have to do is lock the music from being transferred off the SD card, similar to iTunes 
Please fix this, I love Spotify and would love to continue using it 
I can listen to any song I like or want to hear I thank it is great
Love the music
It works perfectly fine for me
Ps3 trouble when i use the ps3 version it says i am already linked and therefore tells me to go to ps3 or sony server etc but not surewhat this all means
Sometimes the search menu just disappears
Would rate it 5 stars but when i use wifi it constantly says Im not connected to the interent, when i am 
Please fix this, i hate using my data to download the songs i want 
Cmon everythings on shuffle, random music pops up and ads 
Its like iTunes for android except it sucks so much 
I guess the only free part is the uninstall button 
Thanks a lot Spotify 
Even advertisement is not to frequent while enjoying my awesome Playlist 
Great job Spotify   lata 
This app really awesome i can listen whatever music i want!
&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
Every time I go on I cant browse or do anything that requires a connection 
I am fully connected to wifi and offline mode is off 
Loved this app when it worked, cant use at all now 
Will cancel if not fixed very soon   
Works great for working out and premium is beyond worth it!!!!
