I always have trouble checking my purchased items 
It could be easier to move around and search in the app 
Can buy stuff online, post items up for sale, keep an eye on your watch list!
Nothing to complain about at all for this APP!
Havent been able to use it yet 
I have tried but it keeps asking for my user name and password and wont let me go any further 
Gets the simple jobs done, able to select and pay on the spot pretty happy with this app what else can i say
I have the same problem on two different phones, even after several updates to the app No matter what I do with the notifications, they never stop 
I have each individual notification type turned off, and I have the general notification toggle turned off 
It even displays a brief popup when I do this which says it is updating the settings 
And yet, the crummy bloop still keeps coming The has been a problem since last year with a Nexus S, and now the same happens with the new Moto G (not that the phone model should have anything to do with the apps own settings) 
I downloaded the ebay app because I had some specific items I wanted to look for and I wasnt at home near my desktop 
The app is well laid out and intuitive to use 
I would recommend it and find myself using the app more often than going into the office to check things out on the desktop 
For viewing and bidding the droid app is the way to go 
If I am closing in on a bid I keep laptop and tablet going but the tablet is my preference 
The slimmed down UI makes it very easy to bid, buy and get notified!
Got to love Ebay and now I have access to it on my phone and Kindle 
SImple and easy to use 
I have this installed on my Kindle device 
Im a bit addicted to EBay so this is perfect for me 
Of course you need Ebay 
I use it a lot and is a must have for my family 
I like it on the kindle just because the size is bigger than my iphone 
Definately a plus app!
I like this app for finding car parts for both my old and new cars its kind of fun to bid on stuff
Makes shopping on Ebay quick and easy 
It is great when you dont have your computer with you, but want to shop 
I love Ebay 
for viewing and bidding the droid app is the way to go 
Works well, no glitches 
hard to find your way around, great for a quick check of items though 
Cannot check ebay messages 
Love this app 
Now I can shop ebay without having to turn on my computer!
Since I never go anywhere w/o my Kindle I always have access to ebay 
Cannot be without the Ebay app at hand 
Love the convenience of shopping and selling on my kindle 
Great place to find &#34;the hard to find&#34; gifts 
This app is perfect 
I downloaded this app on my kindle fire for days I could continue to bid on items when Im away from my computer 
I love it and Im glad I downloaded it!
App worked great at first then it would never open and the kindle would automatically close it out with a error message 
Very simple navagation and browsing tools!
I like that a list of your activity on ebay is easy to see and manage and it doesnt move from your main search list 
Great app, convenient and its free 
Great for watching those bids and just finding special items 
A must have app 
I have been dealing with ebay for years, almost all of my transactions were great 
And the best part about it is you dont have to deal with the over populated communities that we all live in 
Ebay is easy to use and a great way to get products at good prices without driving miles and wasting hours shopping and not finding the product I am looking for 
App is ok 
You can do some basic things with it    probably should have rated it a 4, but my God do I hate ebay   
I had my items to sell listed in minutes and there was even the option of importing pictures from my phone, no need to download to my computer!
Loaded this on my HTC 8X windows phone and it does everything I expect of it 
Very ice app, thanks 
Easy to use and handy 
Log in easy, search easy 
Way better on my tablet than trying to use the web browser!
This app is great!
So much better than the website - just wish I could see my eBay Bucks balance in the app instead of having to go to the site!
This is a nice app to stay informed of new posting on ebay 
I enter the search criteria and it sends me an update if someone posts it 
I love to shop on ebay 
Now i can where ever I have my Kindle 
Makes shopping much more easier 
Both mine and my husbands most used app on our phones and tablets alike 
Very practical and helpful for anyone 
I am a first time user so I am not confident yet 
in using my devise But so far 
so good Ill learn Im only 78 so Ive got plenty of time 
I find this app easy to manage my ebay listing at a glance 
I know you can do more with it but I still use the computer to list my items 
by my title need to  buy means u can not buy any thing from just the enternet u need the app to buy
Online if your not a member you can just pay for ur item And then who ever ships to u like your a member the app doesnt give you a choice it makes u sign in So I was going to purchase something off my kindle but instead had to go find it on eBay on the computer because I wasnt a member
Love this app 
I use it on my Kindle fire all the time 
It is very user friendly 
I would recommend
received quickly and was exactly what I wanted 
Was watching and auction I had a bid on and was able to follow progress of sale very easily 
Simple to use 
up date made it a lot better to buy and sale only if it was a  way to print shippen lable to WiFi printer ill put 5 stars kingblack2210
Makes using my Ebay account easy when I cant get to a computer 
Now I dont miss out when I get out bid
I havent really yet had a chance to use it, but I think it will be valuable for future use
Ive only used this a few times, but I have enjoyed it very much 
All i can say is try it 
This application provided exactly what I would expect from an eBay application 
You can log into the application, view and monitor bids and create new bids 
I did not attempt to perform any sales from the application, but I did check and monitor bids, and it was effective 
I havent used it much but I like the fact that it works very much like the regular PC version 
I would recommend this app to others 
JUst like the it should be 
With this app you can now see you favorite sellers and do everything you need to do 
This app is just like being on your computer but is for your smartphone 
I go on ebay often for auctions and just to browse through a category 
I have no problem purchasing items from this app 
Easy to use especially for someone who likes to search for great deals 
I love it 
I wish the computer version had some of the same filters Couldnt be happier I downloaded this to my Kindle 
I liked having ebay to scan and play with right at my finger tips 
easy to use!get your app now
this app allows me to do everything that the phone app allows 
which is not surpising, because they are virtually the same thing 
I love shopping on ebay this ap allow me to shop on my kindle or iPhone anywhere I go, just love it
Runs smoothly on my Kindle and syncs with my account, therefore all my devices are updated and match The mobile version is easy to use, I havent posted a sale with my Kindle, but I am able to monitor anything I have posted from my phone or computer, and I can easily search and bid on items without any problems 
Very convenient and easy to use 
Its easy to navigate through the different pages or selling, sold, payments, et cetera 
whats there not to like, love and want to buy!
its easy to use & you can create your own account and make tweak it too 
This is an awesome easy to use app 
It even has a few features that the eBay web site does not 
Now I can check my ebay listings with my Kindle Fire any time I am within WiFi range!
Love the reminders, loads fast, doesnt hog memory 
Easily browse thru EBAY with all your favorite sellers and watch list 
this app is amazing it works anywhere i go and its easier then logging into a super slow computer lets go horray for awesome apps
Notifications are helpful when working with other apps 
Easy to navigate and loads quickly 
Very helpful when searching and bidding!
It has really improved my searching for various items having the app handy on both my phone and kindle fire 
I have used it many times since installing without any failures 
I like it and use it 
But I wish it had a link to the full site like the mobile version does 
I find myself having to leave the app to go to website for some things    Like customer service for example 
Understated version of the the websight 
Works well for a scaled down version 
So far no issues 
Obviously not as thorough as the main website but thats the point right
This app makes using ebay a snap on my Kindle 
I recommend this to anyone wanting to use ebay on their Kindle 
I love E-Bay but the format is very difficult to use on the Android phone 
Nothing like using a computer 
I really wanted to like it but find it is to dissimilar to the computer format I am used to 
It is okay 
Hard to find what I am looking for with the little drop downs 
I wouldnt use it to list an item, but I would probably use it to buy and check listings 
This app is easy to navigate and a joy to use!!
It is so much better than opening a browser window and doing that way 
Does everything you need it to!
Gets my items listed fast and easy 
Highly recommended to those looking for business or even fun 
I think this is a great app 
Its very easy to use and easy to navigate 
I use this all the time 
Nice little app lets me connect to ebay with one tap of the finger 
I can check my ebay bids on my kindle whileon the computer doing something else
they have done a good job addressing earlier issues and its become easier to resubmits auctions and change prices 
I use it daily go check my auctions
Very happy with this app 
Does just what I need it to do with frequent buying and selling 
Like the notifications 
Browsing eBay is fun and easy,but on the kindle fire we are stuck using the old version even though there has been an update out for about a month in googles marketplace 
wouldnt recommend Amazons version if you are lucky enough to be able to choose 
This app makes bidding on ebay fast and easy 
It allows you to shop from any place with wifi 
Its awesome 
Ill never use the website again!
This makes it so easy to shop 
Its almost intuitive 
I am really impressed 
Love being able to check my ebay on my phone, huge convenience 
Helps to keep track of your bids 
Yes this one more of my favorite sites 
I go to it often, and with the holidays come up I suspect Ill be frequenting even more 
If u dont have a paypal account you cant buy anything 
Nothing more to say 
This teally sucks 
Makes me not want to do any ratings
Works good just like the computer version, does what it is supposed to do 
I use it all the time 
this app works great if you use ebay alot 
it is easy to naviagte and it feels like you are online at home
I love using the app instead of the website 
App works well on my Kindle fire HD and my android devices 
this is great to have   still learning how to  use 
getting better   like watching auctions   and keeping track what is going on 
If you want to buy things, you dont get as many results for your searches as you would on a pc 
I do both 
So I wish they would fix the problem 
Its annoying when I want to find certain things switching between my kindle and the pc 
So far so good 
Love having Ebay so handy at all times So easy to keep up with my bidding 
You will not be disappointed with this application 
If you want to check up on an item, at any time, this is the one for you!
Just outstanding app for eBay, own a android phone now and this app picked up where my iPhone app left off 
I downloaded this app but never opened it, forgot about it, went on eBay as I usually do 
Then I ran into a problem when I tried to buy something, my payment got hung up, could not make my purchase 
For days I spent time and money calling eBay, Paypal, the bank, all as usual pointed fingers at the other 
Long story short, this app was the problem 
Once it was downloaded from the store (never opened) it altered something and this is all I can use when dealing with eBay 
I like it, it did take some adjusting to go to this app instead of the internet, but it is a good app   so far 
The app is a lot friendlier than the site, and easy to navigate and keep track of my bids 
Requred for me as I have an ebay store and this was simple to download 
Glad they made an app for the android platform!
It is properly laid out which allows me to find and track items I have purchased 
There is also those alerts that are sent on items ordered but not paid for 
I particularly liked that feature because I had some issues earlier with items I had ordered and had difficulty completing the transaction using another app 
What can you say 
Hay its ebay 
I needed the app and use it to compare prices with Amazon 
Only buy if its free shipping other than that prices are kind of high at ebay 
Not sure, but I always check EBay for whatever!
E-bay has a great selection of any item you might want 
My son purchased this App for me and Im still learning to use the Kindle with my limited time to do so 
I would say it works ok but Im disappointed in the Kindle Fire HD, to date 
Hopefully, as I use it, my impression will change 
This app is great 
I do a lot of shopping on ebay so I love this app it is very useful 
If you shop on ebay you should get this app 
This app work really well one of the better one Ive used 
Happy it came along 
If you play or work on ebay then this is one you need   
I am very happy that I can list items for sell from my phone 
It is user friendly and I have never experienced a problem or bug with the ap 
Bought a new tail light assembly for my van via ebay that I found while surfing with my kindle 
Very easy to use 
Lots of adventure and suspense, I really like Daniel Criag as James Bond 007  The bad guy played a very convincing part!
I would recommend this app 
I havent been able to use all the features yet, but it is working good for me!
I am very satisfied with ebay 
they are reliable, honest and always on time with product they send out Will continue to shop on ebay AAA+++
EBay made easy 
I wish amazon could make a similar app 
Always up to date with stuff I love it
THIS APP MAKES IT SO EASY TO LOOK AT EBAY WITHOUT GETTING OUT THE BIG COMPUTER 
I LOVE EBAY ANYWAY AND BEING ABLE TO GET TO IT IN A TOUCH OF THE SCREEN IS WONDERFUL 
I LOVE MY KINDLE 
IT MAKES THING MUCH EASIER 
this app works smoothly 
I enjoy shopping on ebay and this app keeps me in touch when i am away from my computer 
this app was downloaded to kindle 
On Kindle and Android both, eBay is always a reliable shopping tool 
It has an easy interface that allows browsing items and My eBay which allows users to login access to your personal profile and items 
Im still getting used to this app 
I think I prefer to use a desktop/laptop instead 
I just think its easier to search than this app 
I love this App 
Especially if we are travelling I can check auctions of my husbands and that way he doesnt have to find a computer at the hotel immediately 
One wish is that the daily deals could be filtered rather one big list that you have to scroll all the way through to see if something interests you 
Great app to keep track of all purchases and watched items and it connects to PayPal, which makes it even more convenient 
It definitely helps keep track of all purchases made 
Its easier to download app then to have to go to search engines all the time 
Plus it easier to get to 
Quick and easy to view and check up on my auctions when Im away from my computer 
Very good selection arrangement 
The app works slightly differently than the PC version 
Ill revise this review after I have used the product more 
It concerns me that items I list cant be found on the search on this app 
Fine on my computer without the app 
Plus,  glitchy as far as shipping prices being reflected correctly 
Needs more work!
This app is great if you frequently buy or sell on ebay 
It times out a lot though which is really irritating
quick and easy when u need it,thats what apps are for quick to get in and out its great fun for all 
Simple application to select, install and use,Puts e-bay at your fingertips 
It makes  your phone or tablet a tool for accessing your account 
It was easy to download and install 
Works well on my Kindle Fire 
I have yet to have a glitch with it 
Simple to use  
Has all the important features of the classic site 
I tried an earlier version and this has been debugged 
Love this app 
Just got a laptop thinking Id use it for eBay instead of the tablet 
Tried it, but seem to have an easier time with the app 
Will probably go back and forth, but the app is great for checking, searching, etc 
Title says it all 
Text is extremely small on 10&#34; tablet, almost unreadable 
Very few options 
Very limited use on 10&#34; tablet 
I especially love the way it handles my searches where it remembers what I have previously viewed on each search list 
Great way to navigate eBay on my Kindle Fire HD 
Able to enlarge item photos and further zoom to see every detail 
So convenient and easy to use 
The best and easiest way to peruse Ebay simple to use and well put together 
I like it better than the webpage 
This application used to work - now with last 3 &#34;updates&#34; it will not connect to the network 
I even contacted eBay 
The answer    Yes, it is a known issue and we are working on it, but it could take up to 90 days to fix    Maybe 
What a mess!
Good time killer while I am at work 
I can see what deals I can find while I am on lunch and break   
I sell prints on eBay as well as other objects and it is very nice to get immediate notifications when something sells or when a buyer/potential buyer has a question!
Their mobile site seems to be missing some options for sorting that this app has 
I use the app instead of their mobile site 
Love my app 
So easy to take care of business!
I like being on the run and still have access to my business 
I just started using this app and so far so good 
I like that it notifies you if you have won an item and/or have been outbid on an item 
Very convenient app for ebay on a smartphone 
Very well organized and easy to use 
All the options you would want in is self-explanatory
