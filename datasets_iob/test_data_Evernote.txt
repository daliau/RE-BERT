Ive used Evernote for quite awhile to take notes on my Android tablet and be able to share and edit them on any PC with a web browser 
Not as nice as Microsoft OneNote, but at least its cross platform 
Nice to see that it runs on the Kindle Fire HD 
Love that I can sync to my other devices 
It has been a big help in keeping me organized with my lists 
Have everynote you take on your tablet, phone, or laptop synced without touching a buttom 
Very easy to use 
Highly recommend Evernote if you take notes for anything 
I cancelled this app about 10 minutes later, not sure if I didnt give it enough time to understand it or not 
Did not like at all, I use the cozi family app and it seems to work much better for what I need
I use it for school notes and not only can I use on my kindle fire,  I have the app on my cell phone and my laptop,  so I can never lose my information 
love this app on my phone and pc but it has some bugs on kindle 
please fix the terrible spell check for Pc and list the upgrade price in the app and I would pay for premium 
OK, I love Evernote, but sadly cant download it even though it is free because the app store is not available overseas 
Seems silly for a free app, doesnt it 
On other devices such as iphone, and on the google app store, its no problem, but Amazon has put to many restrictions on Kindle Fire, so Im stuck not being able to download any free apps 
I should have bought a different product 
Never lose your notes again, and access them wherever you are, this app is perfect for any mobile note taker 
It performs its basic functions well and works between my pc, phone,  and kindle,  but the organization feels off and their are still occaisonal syncing problems 
I have this app on my pc and love it 
The version on the kindle fire is limited but I can Still use it for most thinks 
Thanks so much!
Its the only tool that works across my devices 
It synchronizing capability is transparent and remarkable 
word word word word
still working out kindle potential but love it thus far     
could be really awesome if I could attached camera pica but dont have that in kindle 
Evernote  goes where I go 
I use it for everything--recipes, receipts, notes of all kinds 
I have copies on my desktop, my iphone and now my kindle fire 
Thanks to the developers 
I am not sure how to get out of the original screen to have the notes listed in another place from the running tab on the main screen R Elliott
I started using Evermore on my PC for school 
I use it for notes, making copies, storing research 
It is such a great tool 
It syncs easily between my PC and Kindle Fire so I can take my notes anywhere 
I use Evernote for all my note taking needs and general memory practice 
I love the fact that I can review and edit my notes on any device and anywhere 
would recommend this to students, great for tagging websites you want to keep to help get some work done!
perfect to keep my Pc synced with my phone and tablet
Works great and synchs to all of my devices 
Using it for homeschool lesson plans 
Very easy to use!
I was first introduced to this app for my job, and now I use it everywhere I go I use it on my Kindle, and have found it to be more than helpful at meetings 
I have a terrible memory, and with Evernote I have been able to keep track of everything 
I love the features and benefits to using it 
The fact that you can clip from the internet is great 
I am glad I stumbled upon this, and couldnt be happier 
It helps alot with school work 
It also syncs with other devices without using a manual device sync 
I just love it!
This app was constantly updating, contacting me and trying to get on my other wireless devices 
It was way too complicated for what I neded - just a simple note pad 
This app is a God send 
I can easily store and organize my thoughts in ways I never imagined 
I love Evernote 
The best feature is being able to email yourself a note and seeing your notes on the web 
I use evernote for everything and love that it works on any computer,  browser, phone,  or tablet 
I try not to waste any natural brainpower on things that evernote can now remember for me 
It is great for note taking or outlining a paper 
I use it at university all the time 
Only complaint is the sharing options are limited 
I have evernote on my laptop and I love it!
I was so happy when I found out that it was on kindle 
I have to say this is the best product of its kind!!
I dont know what I would do without this thing 
I use it for personal applications, as well as in my professional life as a teacher 
Installed everywhere I needed 
A slick note store - really helped me get all of the clutter out of my head!
Yo can see it all everywhere 
very handy to either make quick note while out or lengthy one at home from computerwould recommend to family or friends
I love Evernote simply for the reason that you have your notes accessible from anywhere : kindle,  phone, or PC 
Also love the check box option for my to do lists!
For the price, you cant beat the kindle fire 
I knew that I wouldnt get a calendar or Android Market, so Im giving it 5 stars because it absolutely meets my expectation 
I LOVE THIS APP!!!!!
You can keep picture notes and everything you need to keep in this little app right here 
Sure they use your contacts but thats all they use 
They dont locate you or anything 
They use what they have to to create your account 
So all you haters need to delete the app if you dont like it 
I would recommend this to everyone!!!!!!
So have a great day:)
Good enough synching which is why I needed it in the first place 
Could be more dynamic but its okay so far 
Great for taking down note,  I also use it to write down recipes      
I would advice everyone to get the app 
its the sticky note you have been waiting for
this does everything i was looking for i am a sticky note queen and i can organize all my notes and to dos in one place
With Evernote, no matter where I am, or what device I use, I can quickly jot down notes, ideas, or important info and not worry about where I saved it 
With add-ons like Skitch, I can take pictures of things that inspire my art and make notations right in the image, then Evernote once again makes sure all my devices have a copy 
Very intuitive &amp; user-friendly 
Love that it syncs across all platforms - my laptop, Kindle Fire, Android phone, and even accessible on the web from any computer 
when i first got my tablet, i was not sure what i was going to do about notetaking in class without Word 
this app allows for sharing and can be typed on your laptop as well!
love the functionality of this app 
works well within my kindle fire, and allows me to take great notes during class 
a wonderful application for note taking and the layout even better
Easy, Free, Works great 
I use it for many things and I keep thinking of more 
I wouldnt have a device without it!!
I have evernote on my iPhone, Kindle Fire &amp; laptop 
Its so much easier than having post it notes everywhere 
I recommend this for note takers takers everywhere!!
As a longtime Evernote User, I was very happy to see the very capable Aneroid app works great on my Kindle tablet 
This is an awesome app 
I cant imagine being without it now 
I even take my Bible Study notes in it!
Awesome software - available on kindle, phone and computer and notes are there for you to access and review or edit!
I take message notes at church with Evernote and it is quite useful 
The features appeal to every personality and it is easy to use 
No more need to carry a notepad around with you - this ap replaces the pen and paper 
And what makes it better is that you can have the same note synced on all of your devices - so you can write your shopping list on your computer, and look it up on your iPhone or tablet 
Brilliant in its simplicity 
This app is a life saver!
When your need to jot something down real quick or just take a picture of something to remember 
And with school and the voice dictation on my phone is a life saver with long papers to type 
I can dictate 500 words in no time, and transfer it to a word document!
this app will make you poop your pants!
lol I cant figure out why, but it makes me poop myself every time I open it!
I love pooping though which is why I gave it 5 stars!
Except the program crashed when it asked me to write a review about it 
I like how it syncs to my computer and is easy to use 
This is a great app for thosd needing to create / access information on multiple computers but dont want to have to carry a thumb drive around 
It has an ample amount of free storage and is very User friendly 
I have found it to be very reliable with only minor drawbacks, none worth mentioning 
I agree with concerns about permissions  
The app itself is great 
The fact that I can have it on my Thunderbolt,  Kindle and computer makes it very convenient 
Syncs all three without problems 
So nice not to wonder where you saved your data and be able to access it and update it from multiple devices 
I started working with Evernote last year when looking for a note taking program to organize my class notes 
I needed something that could at least reasonably organize scanned note from classes like Calculus and Gen Chem, where notes cant be taken on the computer reasonably 
In other courses I found evernote to be perfect, but the shear number of notes often ran me into a wall with the limited 60MB 
Since then I have upgraded to the premium edition of Evernote and the service has consistantly gotten better every month 
The 60MB pay wall was well engineered 
It should be noted that most users dont need to worry about running out their quota 
In fact it is nearly impossible to run out your quota if you are only taking text notes and saving web clippings 
You may consider upgrading if archiving large quantities of PDFs and Pictures is your goal On the Kindle Fire this apps start screen is a little redundant 
The New Note button and Attach button are the only two that work 
The add voice note and photo note do the same thing as the attach button 
I dont know how this has changed for the Kindle Fire HD 
The interface has been well redesigned to make working with it more intuitive albeit a little bit chunkier As a premium user I take advantage of the extra space in very creative ways 
I am a student, and just like any other student I sit through countless powerpoint lectures 
I like to use the the table tool (in the desktop client) to put all the slides in one column and the descriptions in the other 
When reading on the Android app you can then quicky and effectively go through andAs for PDFs, there is no integrated reader that allows you to display the files inline like the desktop clients 
Instead the PDFs are shown as attachments 
When clicked they are opened in what ever pdf reader you have - or on the Kindle Fire the PDF is opened in the kindle reader software which is only well designed for reading appropriately formated pdfs 
I would recommend installing Adobe ReaderAdobe Readerwhich perfectly displays PDFs on the kindle fire For whatever reason, on the Kindle Fire voice notes will not play 
I understand that the 1st gen Kindle Fire doesnt have a microphone so no you cant make audio notes Update: Thursday Nov 8th 2012[   ]Evernote announced serious changes to their client and their service addressing many of the concerns of reviewers 
I love this app including the PC version and I especially love the easy sync 
It has more functionality than I expected!
Vastly superior to the other note apps Ive used 
Keeps me organized 
Great way to sync notes across platforms 
I use it in tandem with Pulse to save recipes 
And its free: whats not to love
I really like this app 
I have it on my Kindle Fire an use it for making lists 
The checkbox option comes in very handy 
I use Evernote as my primary note-taking method in college, and to be honest, its been one of the most helpful applications Ive ever used!
My only two minor gripes are that there is a persistant bug that prevents me from editing many of my notes on an iPhone (the screen jumps around with every keypress), and the overly-minimalistic formatting options, necessitating a separate word processor for essays or any other serious papers 
Fix those, and Ill pay for the app with no regrets!
This is a brilliant program 
It syncs with my PC, my Notebook, my Netbook, my Kindle and my android phone seamlessly 
It holds everything from web pages to simple notes to complex itineraries Evernote is my &#34;go-to&#34; program for retaining information 
Thank you EVERNOTE!
I write songs and like to keep a diary so Evernote really helps me keep track of everything 
I also like Skitch, which lets you draw pics and sign your name on important notes 
It is a separate download but once its downloaded you can click the link let you sign or draw onto your notes 
I just use this for everything: grocery lists, recipes, websites, schedules, story writing, class notes, ect 
All in one place 
This is on my computer, Kindle Fire and Iphone and can be synced across all these devices 
I have to say, when it came to using planners, Id always say I prefer paper to electronic 
Not so much anymore, although this isnt a planner, exactly 
But, you can certainly make it one if you wanted 
I love how you can format it with check boxes and tables 
It really has helped me keep organized with everything in one place and easy to find 
No more wondering where I wrote that note down, what that website was, or where my grocery list ran off to 
I know its all right there 
I love how this app syncs with all my devices, inc my phone and tablet 
It has helped me organize my work and personal life so much that I would be lost without it 
I have a droid phone and am used to the Andronotes app so I havent really used this one yet 
I had it on a previous phone and never used it 
I think Im just used to the andronotes, but I will definitely take time to get adjusted to it 
One thing that would make it better than andronotes is if it is alphabetical when searching for notes!
very useful app, you can note sonething in your mobile device then view it on your computer 
or the oppsite :)pls,it has an add-in in outlook too 
Very easy to use 
Works in different applications syncs between all my devices 
Set up very easy and started using right away 
Only had this app for a day but Im in love!
Thank u for providing this 
Only thing I ask is create a way to drag notes from books on kindle fire
I am a busy lady 
Wife, mother, full time employee in public education, student, as well as the founder of two non profit organizations 
I can make a file for everything from my sons funny quotes, to homework and tasks, as well as make separate note files for both of my non profits 
The only down side is that not all the options available on your computer and tablet are available on the phone application 
But I am still over the moon about this app!
App has been invaluable to me in keeping track of certain articles as well as being able to send them to my different email sites 
I have had it for several months 
It works well with my Kindle Fire 
great for multiple device users 
i have several and can share with the wife instantly 
i had go set it up for her but thats not the point
So far,this app is helping me be organized 
I seem to have so many little things I have to do and re do &amp; I was just about to give up, then Evernote, so far, has saved the day!!!
I use this for my business and it makes delegating and tracking my &quot;to do&quot; list so much more convenient 
I love how you can create separate notebooks and include attachments for any use 
They need to fix the butt ugly iphone version 
Hoping they dont roll out the ugly as hell iphone version for kindle 
I have used evermore for over six months and so far it has met my needs adequately 
I am still concerned about the privacy issues 
I love it 
I wish I knew how to rotate a picture but Im learning more and more each day for an old geezer 
Id like a complete substitute for OneNote, and this isnt it, but it does a lot 
I like synchronizing across platforms, especially 
I use this everyday 
it is on every device I own 
I even love the Internet browser &quot;clipper&quot; 
I never forget anything anymore!!
Evernote is one of the note apps thats been around for a while and is very popular 
As a result, its been well tested, debugged, and refined over the years and you can expect a smooth, bug-free, and capable app when you buy it 
Evernote has exceptional file and information handling capabilities and allows you to capture, store and share not just notes but photos, webpages, freehand drawings and graphics, and pretty much anything you want 
The premium edition allows your friends to access and modify your notes and so offers group collaboration capabilities Another area Evernote excels in is the sheer number and diversity of its companion apps 
Just a quick look at what was available at the Apple store revealed no less than 20 and there were more that I didnt bother to scroll through when I stopped 
These included:Evercrane--a file and note management app providing quick sorting and moving featuresMoveover--another file and note management appClever--a powerful interface and client app with many useful functions (too many to list here)Evernote Food--a recipe programEvernote Hello--a powerful contacts managervJournal for Evernote--a daily journal programFastEver--quickly add notes, tags, and organize notes into notebooksEverclip--a webpage clipperFastEver Snap--a camera for EvernoteEverConvertor--a currency converter for EvernoteCheckEver--a way to manage your checklistsQEver--add reminders to your notesENPower--quick access to your Evernote notes, notebooks, and  tagsMultiSnap--quickly snap and send photosMoveEver--another powerful sort and organizer app similar to MoveOver and EvercraneTap2Ever--fast Evernote uploaderEverGear--note and photo posting appEverWord--EverNote flashcards app with database-like capabilitiesEverEPub--make an EPub book from your notesEverLog--a logging and posting app for EverNoteThats just some of the companion apps that I saw 
There are more and there is often more than one app available in a particular category (note management, daily journal, etc ) so that if you dont like that particular companion app there may be another you will like In reading the reviews here I note that some people didnt like Evernote wanting access to all of their contacts, which they considered an invasion of privacy 
So if this is a probem for you you should consider that before buying the app Overall Evernote offers a lot of value for the money and has the most add-ons and companion apps of any app in the note category 
There is something for just about everyone so if youre looking for a good note and task app Evernote is one of the top offerings that you should consider 
I have Evernote apps on my Kindle Fire, iphone, ans browser at work and Im able to email myself notes, links, etc and then open in any said mediums and since 
absolute must have!!!
Useful in too many ways to list 
Anything you need to save online and/or add notes to comes together perfectly in this app 
The easy to use UI and cross platform syncing and integration is what puts this app above the rest 
I use it on my phone, my laptop and iTouch and my tablet and it syncs instantly and seamlessly 
Evernote is wonderful app Really helps keep me on point 
I love the fact that it synchs across all my devices automatically 
Killer app on my Kindle Fire, iMac, HTC One S, etc 
Just love it!
I was looking for and quick and easy way to write on my kindle and have access to it everywhere 
just what I needed
This app is a dream come true for list makers!
I have it downloaded on all of my devices and use it every day 
Evernote works so well with all of my devices 
I love having one place to go and see all my notes 
I use it at work, at home and on my phones and tablets 
Its seamless and so well done 
using this app on kindle fire is excellent!
i have used it to take notes in classes and it works brilliantly 
i can access my notes from my other computers, organize them in notebooks and tags and add web content and other attachments that make this app an excellent addition to any computer, tablet, or phone 
if you ever need to make checklists, remember names or emails, or take notes this is the app for you 
Simple and easy to use 
Like the ability to format notes in various ways and the sync to web works great as well 
The amount of storage in the free version is more than enough for my needs 
Evernote has been a go-to app at home and on my phone for a little over a year 
The PC version is atrocious but the MAC version is pretty decent 
Its a bit processor heavy but the updates are tweaking it into place (hopefully) 
The Android App has been improving over the releases and as a paid subscriber Ive invested a lot of time into making a usable and searchable database for multiple projects from digital to analog projects
fast, easy, and able to reach your notes anywhere 
I like simple 
Evernote is just that 
No fancy stuff just what a writer needs 
I have been using it for about a month now and I put everything in it!
I even use the email and it works great 
Great piece of software 
This app is great, compatible with so many programs, great sharing options and the sync has never failed me between my PC, GS3, Kindle Fire and Notebook!
I Highly recommend this app for anyone who needs to list, note, share or do just about anything else it offers!
I clip selected text, web pages and links and can access them later on any of my devices 
I also create short notes and to-do lists with Evernote 
Ive only used the free version so far but I love it and recommend it highly 
Big fan of Evernote 
Its my business goto, safe for ideas, and collector of things that intrigue me on the internet 
Check it out 
Its great 
I found the app to be too invasive in that it wants you to load it up will all sorts of personal information on all of your devices that it will then share with, seemingly, anyone who wants it 
I can put info, tasks and files on my e-mail that I can share with all of my devices without Evernote snooping into them 
I always liked evernote I can do my homework where ever and print it out from the website I save notes from school and able to save them I specific folders for later review and print I highly recommend this app for students especially students on the Go!
I use this app pretty much everyday for storing interesting quotes, or jotting down ideas 
It has allowed me to get rid of my notebooks and sticky notes, and consolidate them into something that virtually consumes no room/work space 
this is a terrific tool for organizing your thoughts 
i highly recommend it 
now, if only i can get the bluetooth keyboard working cleanly with my kindle fire hd      
love this one enough to download to phone and kindle 
keeps notes organized 
sync feature really convenient 
use it for school assignments on the go and sync and save often 
works well with awesome notes   
App never downloaded onto my Kindle 
Free or not, I expect it to "get here "
Got another app instead 
I dont understand 
Its the only download problem Ive had so far 
not sure what I can add that hasnt already been said in the 2131 reviews already posted 
love the ease of the app and cross platform 
it works great and wicked fast 
I like that this can act as my idea pad for songs and screenplays 
The best thing is that I can access it on any device with the same e-mail!
this app has completely changed and reorganized my life    from business cards that I get, to ideas I have and want to be able to access from anywhere, to pretty much WHATEVER    this app has been amazing 
I will be purchasing the full version soon 
its that good!
this is the only app i have ever taken the time to review    it rocks 
Had a problem with it syncing 
with my laptop but a simple reinstall fixed that 
It is an awesome app 
This app is on all my devices my Mac, my kindle, my phone and its accessible from the Internet!
I dont know where Id be without Evernote!
I first tried this on my desktop but on the Fire it has thus far been unusable 
I cannot sign in with the password I use on the desktop, cannot reset the password because it not recognize the email address, and cannot register because the same email it does not recognize is allready in use 
For use on multiple devices this app is a sink hole for wasting time and effort trying to set it up 
I wish I had started using this sooner 
I love that I can access the information from my phone, computer, and Kindle 
Honestly havent used it yet, but with so many reviews entered why should you care
Make a note of that 
i love this app 
it is so easy to use and works on all my platforms from apple to my kindle 
This app is very organized 
If youre like me and jot things down on whatever scrap of paper is available, this is an excellent choice 
I use it on my Kindle and havent had any problems with it so far 
I would recommend this to anyone 
I have discovered this program as I was looking for a way to making my job in writing easier and I must say that I am very pleased 
I can now work ok my computer either locally or by the net as well as on my Kindle tablet 
I am totally satisfied!!!
I save everything on Evernote, I mean pictures, magazine clips, recipes, thoughts, you name it 
The best part is I can access it on my kindle, phone, and computer 
love to save all my notes because I have short term memory, not sure if its cause from all the weed I used to smoke 
I love this app 
the only thing I hate is that the government has access to all my movie ideas which I have seen come to film threw out the years 
but thats the price I have to pay for not getting my lazy beer drinking fat asss off my couch and making them myself      sigh 
anyways love the app!
Ive used this app to plan an entire choir tour to Germany and Austria this past May, and am currently working on digitizing a suggested menu for a fine dining restaurant 
Works amazingly, along with Skitch, but I wish there was a way to import notes into a type of presentation app 
All in all, very helpful!
Convenient to have on my kindle, easy to use, whats not to love
I use it for my grocery and to-do lists and I love it!
love the program, best thing that I can use to keep track of all my notes I scatter around 
Keeps me well organized and happy with all of everyday task and Internet notes
The developer is devoted to improving the product and making it easier to interface with browsers 
Whats more, its cloud interface allows seamless synch 
with all your computers 
Great app that is attractive, easy to learn and use and helpful in many levels of life organization 
Grateful I finally decided to try it out 
i use it for work and as personal journal 
replaced colornote, delicious, and google drive 
it gets better everyday    
sometime there or appointments 6 months away an I need a notice with an alarm there is not  an alarm on evernote are Ihave havent found one but this help I always want an alarm
Ive used this for over a year 
Helps me keep organized 
Sharing notes with other users is awesome 
awesome app, i didnt like evernote at first but now that i have a kindle its lightened my load by 90 percent, no more folders packed with paper, i can carry every thing with me without having to suffer from all the weight in my purse 
i just scan everything into evernote and it automatically files everything for me 
good job guys!!
i had to switch Kindles after one was faulty and Evernote was an easy way to keep all my documents 
the only thing is that it doesnt save larger files 
I use this when I dont have access to my computer to type up my homework 
and because I have the app on my phone I can work on my homework anywhere 
great app that does what it says 
use it on my kindle and my Pc would recommend to everybody 
only gripe is the interface on the kindle could be better 
i really like its shared feature 
i can write a note and have it on my phone, computer and tablet 
I like that it can do photos videos audio and text 
I like the way you can organize into notebooks 
everything is very useful 
I like it a lot 
great app for taking notes across all platforms 
no matter where I am or what device I have available I can always update or create notes
